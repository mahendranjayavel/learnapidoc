Answer key:

**Resource description:**

- wordy. should be more concise and action-oriented
- Surfreport probably shouldnâ€™t capitalized

**Endpoints and definition:**

- GET/POST should just be GET

- no need for colon in `{:beachId}`

- consider color coding <span style="color: green">{beachId}</span>

**Parameters:**

- Query string parameters are mixed into same table as Path parameters. Separate into different tables.

- Where you get the beach ID isn't specified

- Number versus Integer is potentially inconsistent. Technically, a number refers to a float or double (which would allow for decimals), while an integer refers to a whole number. In this case, I doubt the beach IDs have decimals.

- No default specified for `time` parameter

- With `time` data types, why do some data types have examples but not all?

**Sample request:**

- not in curl format

- only one query string parameter shown; should include `time` too

- `zip` query string parameter is included but not defined anywhere

- `appID` includes long API key that should likely be shortened to a variable such as `APIKEY`

**Sample response:**

- includes `riptide` element that isn't defined in response definition

- `riptide` missing comma after second instance

- `riptide` not shown in third hour block

- indentation formatting is a bit messed up with word riptide

**Response definition:**

- `wind` description doesn't indicate what measurement is used (knots?)

- for `wind`, "int" should be spelled out as integer

- `watertemp` doesn't indicate measurement units either

- `surfheight` data type is "Map" when it should be Integer

- `recommendation` doesn't include more detail such as how many possible recommendation strings are available, and what they even mean.

- `surfheight` should either be `surf_height` or `surfheight` -- response example conflicts with usage in response definition table

- no hierarchy expressed for child elements (e.g., `tide`, `wind`, `watertemp`)
