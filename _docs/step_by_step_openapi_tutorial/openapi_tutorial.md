If you want to build the OpenAPI spec by hand in a text editor, this tutorial will help you get started. Even though documentation isn't necessarily linear, I break down the various sections in the OpenAPI YAML file and go through them line by line. Approaching the OpenAPI file manually requires a more advanced understanding of the spec, YAML or JSON syntax, and how to approach strategies specific to your API. If you're a beginner or want a visual editor, check out the [Getting started tutorial: Using Stoplight Studio to create an OpenAPI specification document](pubapis_openapis_quickstart_stoplight.html) instead.
