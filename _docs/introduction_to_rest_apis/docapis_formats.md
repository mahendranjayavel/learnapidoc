You can read this content in several alternative formats:

{: style="margin-left: 20px"}
&ndash; <a href="https://idbwrtng.com/learnapidoc-pdf"><i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> PDF</a> (last-generated: {{page.last-modified}}) ~ 900 pages

{: style="margin-left: 20px"}
&ndash; <a href="https://idbwrtng.com/learnapidoc-mobi"><i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"></i> Kindle (MOBI)</a> (last-generated: {{page.last-modified}}) ~250 MB

{: style="margin-left: 20px"}
&ndash; <a href="https://idbwrtng.com/learnapidoc-epub"><i class="fa fa-file-text" aria-hidden="true"></i> EPUB</a> (last-generated: {{page.last-modified}}) ~150 MB

I periodically regenerate these formats, so the content should more or less be the same across web, PDF, Kindle, and EPUB.

{: .note}
In the future, I plan to break this content up into smaller outputs. For now, though, the PDF and eBooks are massive in length.

## PDF

To read the content as PDF, I recommended that you either read the PDF in [Adobe Acrobat Reader DC](https://get.adobe.com/reader/) (or similar) so that you can highlight and annotate the content, or that you print only specific sections at a time, defining the page ranges. Otherwise, this 900+ page PDF will consume an entire tree.

## Kindle

To read the content on Kindle device:

1.  Click the **Kindle (MOBI)** file above. When you do, the MOBI file downloads to your computer.
2.  Connect your Kindle device to your computer with a USB cord. Your Kindle device will indicate that it's in USB Drive Mode.
3.  In Finder (Mac) or Explorer (Windows), look for a new Kindle drive icon to appear, and open it.
4.  Drag the `docapis.mobi` file into the `Documents` folder on the Kindle drive. Wait for the file to transfer.
5.  Disconnect the USB cord (on a Mac, eject the Kindle drive first). Then look at the list of books in your Kindle's "Your Library." You will see "Documenting APIs" as a new title.

    On your Kindle, click Contents button on the Kindle nav bar to browse through the sections at any time.

To update an existing version of the book you already put on Kindle, plug in your USB cord, open your `Documents` folder, delete the `docapis.mobi` file and companion directory, then repeat the above steps.

You can also read the content on a Kindle viewer on your computer. The content added to your physical device automatically syncs with the computer app.

(Note: The ebook version isn't on Amazon.com yet, so you have to download the file and transfer it manually to your device.)

## EPUB

For other e-readers that require EPUB format, download the EPUB file above.

## Other formats

If you need the content in another format, download the MOBI file and then convert it to a plethora of other formats through [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/).

If you spot formatting issues, let me know. It's hard for me to spot check 900 pages of content across multiple mediums. If a screenshot is too large or there's weird spacing or other issues, [drop me a note](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/contact){: .noCrossRef}.
