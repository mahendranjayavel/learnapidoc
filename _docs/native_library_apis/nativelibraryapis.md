Native library APIs refer to Java, C++, or other programming-specific APIs. In this model, rather than making requests across the web for the information, you download a library of code and integrate it into your project. The library is compiled directly into your application's build (rather than accessed through web protocols as with REST APIs). Although this type of API is less common, I include it here in part to clarify what makes REST APIs so different from native library APIs.
