17. *Could you adopt some form of pair programming that involves recording what the engineer does so that you can go back and later learn it? Isn’t that the ideal compromise?*

*How familiar do you need to be with the code to make sense of it? Somewhat but not 100%. I think if you can understand the fundamentals, then others can talk you through the rest.*

*Is documenting code the most fun thing, or the least? It is quite fun because you can make it work.*

*How do you know what’s obvious and not in code?*
