## High level strategies for documenting code

Start simple or more complex. Do you start with the simplest implementation and work your way progressively more complicated?*

*Some software engineers intuitively begin to familiarize themselves with a new API and start working from an example. They prefer to immediately dive into the matter. They get to know the API bottom-up, based on the code. Other engineers find it useful to first understand the API as a whole. Before they start working, they read conceptual information and get into the matter top-down. These different patterns became especially obvious during our series of observation (see image 1). Out of 11 test persons, six viewed and partly read the conceptual information of the tested manufacturer documentation. Five ignored the concept part.* [API documentation – What software engineers can teach us](https://www.parson-europe.com/en/blog/440-api-documentation.html)

*4. Are there 2 types of learners — the top down (from concept to implementation) learner, and the bottom up (from code to understanding)? What other types of learners might there be? I like this dichotomy of learner types. Bottom up and top down learners. And how about a bit of both. You toggle back and forth between the two.*

 *What do we learn from that CDQ article on the API doc study? There are both systematic and opportunistic software developers, and you have to write for both. Nothing new here since John carroll.*

*Should you describe criteria around code samples, such as that they must be functional in some context? Yeah, I like this. Like, when you talk with devs, you should press them for code examples, and then press them to make them work.*

*When you learn code, what’s the best way for you personally to learn? Start simple, then get more complex. Show me the basic pattern, and then I will build from there. Jekyll’s minimal theme was great for this.*

*What resources for learning code are the most popular currently? Codester was great. And others*.
