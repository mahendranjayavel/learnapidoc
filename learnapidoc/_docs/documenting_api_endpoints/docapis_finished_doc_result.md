Let's pull together the various parts we've worked on and bring them together to showcase the full example.

{% include random_ad4.html %}

<div class="docSample">
{% include_relative surfreport_resource_description.html %}
{% include_relative surfreport_endpoint.html %}
{% include_relative surfreport_parameters.html %}
{% include_relative surfreport_request.html %}
{% include_relative surfreport_response.html %}
</div>

{% include image_ad_right.html %}

{% include random_ad3.html %}

And that's it. If you have a lot of endpoints to document, you'll probably want to create templates that follow a common structure. Better yet, when you push your reference documentation into the OpenAPI specification, it makes publishing your content even easier. We'll dive more into the OpenAPI specification in the next section, [OpenAPI spec and generated reference docs](restapispecifications.html).

## Next steps

Now that you've completed the [API reference tutorial](docapis_api_reference_tutorial_overview.html), you're ready to do some activities.

{% include random_ad2.html %}

There are two activities in this section:

* [Activity: What's wrong with this API reference topic](docapis_api_whats_wrong_activity.html)
* [Activity: Evaluate API reference docs](docapis_api_reference_activity.html)

{% include ads.html %}
