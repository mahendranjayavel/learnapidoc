This part of the activity might be challenging, but here is where you'll start building some examples for your portfolio.

1.  In the same project as before, identify one of the API reference topics that needs help. (If the API has a new reference endpoint to document, focus on this endpoint.)
2.  Edit the topic to improve it. (If it's a new endpoint, write the documentation for it.)
6.  Create a [pull request](pubapis_github_pull_requests.html) and contribute your edits to the project.
